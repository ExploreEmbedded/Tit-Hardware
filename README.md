# Tit-Hardware
Hardware design files for Tit with Atmega328pb 

Ever wanted to have two hardware Serial Ports, two SPI, two I2C and more PWM pins on the Arduino Pro Mini? Tit has all of this, and retains the same form factor. Tit uses Atmega328PB at its core. 

Tit, is pin compatible with Arduino Pro Mini, the chip Atmega328pb is software compatible with Atmega328p. Hence all the existing code and libraries should work without any changes. Tit uses higher version of avr-gcc toolchain, we have bundled it up as a package along with additional libraries required to access the extra features. Check the setup section on installing support for the board in the Arduino IDE.
